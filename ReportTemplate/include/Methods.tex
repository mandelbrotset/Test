\section{Conflicts Analyzer}
To classify conflicts, we aim to use the tool Conflicts Analyzer developed by Accioly(source). This tool automatically clones Github projects and performs the historical merges of the projects using the merge tool SSMerge(source), which is a semistructured merge tool. When semantic merge-conflicts occur, Conflicts Analyzer classifies them according to the conflict patterns defined by Accioly(source).
\section{Merge-conflict Resolution Patterns}
We strive to identify resolution patterns for each conflict pattern manually and thereafter extend our tool to be able to detect how frequent each resolution pattern occurs.
