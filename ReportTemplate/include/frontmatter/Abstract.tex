\section*{Abstract}
In collaborative software development, conflicts often arise when merging different versions of the code. These are often solved manually, which slows down productivity. To develop a tool that assists in the resolution process, we aim to study how developers resolve conflicts and try to identify patterns in the resolutions. We do this by studying large open-source projects on GitHub.

We found that for conflicts regarding code inside methods or constructors, the currently checked out version was chosen in 75\% of the cases. We also found that if one of these versions contain more instances of the keyword if, that version was chosen in 84\% of the cases.
