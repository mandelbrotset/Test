\chapter{Conclusion}
The most important result in this study is that in cases of conflicting code in methods or constructors, when the conflict is caused not only by different spacing, in 3 out of 4 cases, developers tend to choose the left version when merging. The reasons for this is unclear, but there are two main scenarios that need to be considered; when pulling a remote branch and when merging a local branch into another one.

The left version is the commit that the developer who performs the merge has checked out when merging. If the conflicting merge is a result of pulling a remote branch, the left version is likely his own code, and the right version someone elseâ€™s code. This study has not gone into why developers resolves conflicts this way, but it might be interesting for future studies to investigate this further. If the conflicting merge is a result of merging a local branch into another one, the left version is the branch which the other branch was merged into.

Another interesting note about the results is that versions containing more of the keywords print and log are only chosen about 1 out of 4 times. This might be because printouts and logging statements are removed at the time of the merge, when hopefully the newly implemented code is working as intended and tested, thus printouts and logs is no longer needed. Furthermore, it is very popular to choose a version containing more of the keyword if. The reason may be that one version has a check for an exception that the other version has forgotten, such as a null-check. It might also be because a new parameter has been implemented that switches a feature on and off, or related to variance.
