\section{Repositories to analyze}
Since we are going for a quantitative analysis, we want to analyse fairly big projects that contain many commits and many forks along with many branches. This is because we want to cover as much of variant possibilities as possible to gain the most accurate result. To satisfy these requirements, the 20 top starred Java repositories on GitHub were chosen.
\paragraph*{}
The projects listed in Table (no) were cloned so that Git commands could be used to analyze the repositories. Elasticsearch was chosen as the project for our initial analysis since it has a vast number of commits (more than 20000) and forks.
\paragraph*{}
Elasticsearch is a distributed search engine used for analysing data in realtime.
